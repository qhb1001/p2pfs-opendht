# Embedding Python in C Program

According to the development note in README.md, we are going to adopt python library as the interactive window between FUSE and OpenDHT. Then, the main problem lies at the correct way to communicate C program with Python program. 

In the Python official documentation, they have already developed the header files for C. On Unix, these are located in the directories `*prefix*/include/pythonversion/` and `*exec_prefix*/include/pythonversion/`, where `prefix` and `exec_prefix` are defined by the corresponding parameters to Pythonâ€™s **configure** script and *version* is `'%d.%d' % sys.version_info[:2]`.

While I don't know where to look for the Python's configure script, I run `grep -r '/include/python' .` at the root directory and find the path where header files resides is `/usr/include/python3.5m`. 

Though afterwards, I find the link to get the exact cflags to compile the c source code at [here](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html#compiling-and-linking-under-unix-like-systems). And by making use of `grep` command, I find the python3-config file is located at `/usr/bin/python3-config`. The rseult of command `/usr/bin/python3-config --cflags` is below: 

```cmd
-I/usr/include/python3.5m -I/usr/include/python3.5m  -Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -g -fstack-protector-strong -Wformat -Werror=format-security  -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
```
